This folder contains a PlantUML diagram for the project.

File: project.puml

How to render:

1) VS Code: install the "PlantUML" extension (by jebbs). Open `project.puml` and use the preview.

2) Command line (requires Java and plantuml.jar):
   java -jar plantuml.jar project.puml

3) Online: paste the PlantUML content into an online PlantUML renderer (https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml).

Notes:
- The diagram includes main classes, interfaces and relationships found under `src/main/java/com/week7`.
- There are two `Person` classes in different packages; one is shown as `Person` and the other as `Person2` (same shape).
